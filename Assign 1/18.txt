18. Write a Java Program to print all the Prime Factors of the Given Number.

step1: start
step2: input a no. n
step3: n is divisible by 2, print 2 and divide n by 2, now n must be odd 
step4:  Now start a loop from i = 3 to square root of n,
 While i divides n, print i and 
 divide n by i, 
 increment i by 2 and continue
step5:If n is a prime number and is greater than 2,
 then n will not become 1 by above two steps,
 So print n if it is greater than 2
 step6 : End
